# Mall Customer Segmentation

## Project Overview
This project performs **unsupervised learning** to cluster mall customers based on their **annual income** and **spending score**.  
Dataset: *Mall Customer Data* from Kaggle.  

## Steps Followed
1. **Data Preprocessing** – handled scaling for clustering algorithms.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** – visualized customer distribution.  
3. **Clustering** – applied **K-Means algorithm**.  
4. **Optimal K** – determined the best number of clusters using the Elbow method.  
5. **Visualization** – created 2D scatter plots to show customer groups.  

## Results
- Identified distinct customer groups such as high-income/high-spenders, low-income/low-spenders, etc.  
- Business applications: targeted marketing, personalized promotions.
